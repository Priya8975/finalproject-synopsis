**BE PROJECT SYNOPSIS**


**1) Title of the project:** IOT based Health Monitoring System.

**2) Domain of the Project:**   IOT** 

**3) Keywords :**   Health Care System for Remote Access of the patient data

**4) Problem Definition:** To create a platform for both patients and hospitals to render the information of patients and diagnose the patient’s health on a real time basis and if necessary send emergency medical assistance from the nearest hospital to the patient’s location.  

**5) Abstract:**

**	The increased use of mobile technologies and smart devices in the health zone has brought an extraordinary effect on the world’s critical care. Health specialists and doctors are using these technologies to create critical change in medicinal services during clinical settings. Likewise, many users are being served from the upsides of the M-Health (Mobile Health) applications and E-Health (social insurance upheld by ICT) to enhance, help and assist their well-being. The Internet of things is progressively permitting to coordinate gadgets fit for associating with the Internet and give data on the condition of health of patients and give data continuously to specialists who help. The main aim of this ‘Acknowledgement based PHR system using clustering.’ is to build up a system fit for observing vital body signs, for example, body temperature, heart rate, pulse oximetry. The system is additionally equipped for alert systems and a symptoms pattern recognition to ease the diagnosis of the patient. To accomplish this, the system involves many sensors to screen fundamental signs that can be interfaced to the doctor’s web. The gadget will exchange the readings from the sensor to cloud remotely and the information gathered will be accessible for analysis progressively. It has the capacity of reading and transmitting emergency signs to the cloud and then to doctor’s web portal. These readings can be utilized to recognize the health state of the patient and as an alert system against the emergency health condition.













**6) Scope of the Project:** 
**


1. The given system automatically monitors the health parameters of the patient to predict and give appropriate suggestions on any kind of disease that prevents patients from the pain of paying frequent visits to the clinics or hospitals. So this system can be set up in the hospitals or at the home to send regular health parameters to the doctors.
1. This can be further improved by adding machine learning to facilitate doctors and the patients. For instance, if the patient's health is changing in the same pattern as the previous patient then the older data can be used to assess the newer patient and estimate any consequences.

1. Future scope for this project would be to integrate all the sensors into a small single chip or something like a wrist watch to make it simple to use.
